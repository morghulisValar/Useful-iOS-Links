I am working on making a screen which uses a scroll view and a toolbar at the bottom. The scroll view needs to hold various items, typically textfields, uiviews,image and label.

First of all scrolled a toolbar at the bottom in the viewcontroller scene. Also added a scroll view. 

Added constraint to the toolbar which are all 0. Constraint to margin is false. Similarly for the scroll view, all the four constraint are set to zero.

Now, i will use a uiview inside the scroll view and set it's constraint to all zero's such that it fits to the scroll view. The name of the uiview is changed to ContentView.

Now, ctrl drag from the contentview in the document window to the viewcontroller's view. select the option for equal width.
