I happened to get a laptop on which there are settings like username and user-email already set as global variable.

Now, i needed to change it to have my username and email so that it reflects my contribution whenever a commit is made by me.

To change the user name and email -

open the gitconfig file located in the home folder.

$ vim ~/.gitconfig

I changed the email to be mine and save it. :wq)

It did not show user.name in my case. So, 

$ git config --global --unset-all user.name
$ git config --global --add user.name "newUserName"

The remote origin url has to be changed. So,

$ git remote set-url origin yourRemoteURLtoBePlacedHere
